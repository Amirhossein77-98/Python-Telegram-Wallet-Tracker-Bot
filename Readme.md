# Python Telegram Wallet Tracker Bot
This is a Telegram bot that can track Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) wallets. It can accept a limited number of users and notify them of new transactions on their wallets.

# How it works
The user sends the wallet address, the name of the wallet, and the source (etherscan.io or bscscan.io) to the bot.
The bot will save the wallet details in a SQLite database.
The bot will check for new transactions of the wallets periodically (every 10 seconds by default) and will send the transaction details to the userâ€™s private chat.
The user can manage the wallets and delete them through commands or inline keyboard buttons.
